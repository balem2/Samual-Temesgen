      <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
      <article>
        HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is a markup language used for
        structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the
        fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML
        Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application
        Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser
        vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft). HTML5 was first
        released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008 with a major update
        and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to
        improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other
        new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and
        consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers,
        parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity, and to remain
        backward-compatible with older software.
